# Non-Derivable Claims

This document provides a clear list of claims that are explicitly non-derivable from the system's output. It is a core component of the Interpretation Quarantine Layer.

## 1. Moral & Ethical Claims

- **NON-DERIVABLE:** Any claim about whether a historical structure was "good," "bad," "just," or "unjust."
- **REASON:** The system is a descriptive, not a normative, engine.

## 2. Predictive Claims

- **NON-DERIVABLE:** Any claim about the future trajectory of a network, institution, or structure.
- **REASON:** The system analyzes historical data. It is not a predictive model.

## 3. Causal Claims Beyond Evidence

- **NON-DERIVABLE:** Any claim of causality (e.g., "Family X *caused* the decline of Y") unless it is directly supported by and cited from a primary source document that shows evidence of coordination.
- **REASON:** The system shows correlation and continuity, not necessarily causation.

## 4. Policy & Political Prescriptions

- **NON-DERIVABLE:** Any claim about what policies should be enacted or what political actions should be taken in the present day.
- **REASON:** The system provides historical context. It does not offer solutions for contemporary issues.
