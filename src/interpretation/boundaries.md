# Interpretation Boundaries

This document defines the strict boundaries of what the Echo Substrate / Global Nexus system claims to produce. It is a core component of the Interpretation Quarantine Layer.

## 1. What This System Produces

This system produces **historical structural analysis only**. Specifically, it generates:

*   **Evidence-based claims** about the continuity of influence, access, and resources within documented networks.
*   **Visualizations** of these networks and their persistence over time.
*   **Statistical measures** of representation against defined population baselines.

## 2. What This System Does NOT Produce

This system **does not** produce:

*   **Policy implications or recommendations.**
*   **Moral or ethical judgments** about the actors or structures it analyzes.
*   **Predictions** about future events.
*   **Causal claims** that are not explicitly supported by primary source evidence of coordination.

## 3. The "Therefore" Prohibition

No "therefore" statements are permitted. The system describes *what is*, but it does not prescribe *what should be done*.

*   **ALLOWED:** "The data shows a 30% over-representation of Family X in senatorial seats over 50 years."
*   **PROHIBITED:** "The data shows a 30% over-representation, *therefore* term limits should be enacted."

Any user or external system that adds a "therefore" is operating outside this framework.
