# Prohibited Inferences

This document lists specific inferences that are explicitly prohibited from being drawn from the system's output. This is a core component of the Interpretation Quarantine Layer.

## 1. The Intentionality Fallacy

*   **PROHIBITED INFERENCE:** That observed patterns of continuity imply conscious, coordinated, long-term strategy by the actors involved.
*   **CORRECT INTERPRETATION:** Continuity can emerge from decentralized incentives, institutional inertia, or path dependence. The system's default assumption is the **Structural Null Hypothesis**.

## 2. The Inevitability Fallacy

*   **PROHIBITED INFERENCE:** That because a structure has persisted, it is inevitable, natural, or optimal.
*   **CORRECT INTERPRETATION:** The system documents historical persistence. It makes no claims about the necessity or desirability of these structures.

## 3. The Absolution Fallacy

*   **PROHIBITED INFERENCE:** That because a phenomenon is "structural," no individual actors bear responsibility for their actions within that structure.
*   **CORRECT INTERPRETATION:** The system analyzes structures. It does not absolve individuals of accountability for their choices.

## 4. The Homogeneity Fallacy

*   **PROHIBITED INFERENCE:** That members of a documented network (e.g., a "kinship network") are a monolithic bloc with unified interests and beliefs.
*   **CORRECT INTERPRETATION:** The system documents connections and access. It does not make claims about the internal politics, disagreements, or diversity within a network.
